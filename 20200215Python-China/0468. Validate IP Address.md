### [468\. Validate IP Address](https://leetcode-cn.com/problems/validate-ip-address/)

Difficulty: **ä¸­ç­‰**


Write a function to check whether an input string is a valid IPv4 address or IPv6 address or neither.

**IPv4** addresses are canonically represented in dot-decimal notation, which consists of four decimal numbers, each ranging from 0 to 255, separated by dots ("."), e.g.,`172.16.254.1`;

Besides, leading zeros in the IPv4 is invalid. For example, the address `172.16.254.01` is invalid.

**IPv6** addresses are represented as eight groups of four hexadecimal digits, each group representing 16 bits. The groups are separated by colons (":"). For example, the address `2001:0db8:85a3:0000:0000:8a2e:0370:7334` is a valid one. Also, we could omit some leading zeros among four hexadecimal digits and some low-case characters in the address to upper-case ones, so `2001:db8:85a3:0:0:8A2E:0370:7334` is also a valid IPv6 address(Omit leading zeros and using upper cases).

However, we don't replace a consecutive group of zero value with a single empty group using two consecutive colons (::) to pursue simplicity. For example, `2001:0db8:85a3::8A2E:0370:7334` is an invalid IPv6 address.

Besides, extra leading zeros in the IPv6 is also invalid. For example, the address `02001:0db8:85a3:0000:0000:8a2e:0370:7334` is invalid.

**Note:** You may assume there is no extra space or special characters in the input string.

**Example 1:**  

```
Input: "172.16.254.1"

Output: "IPv4"

Explanation: This is a valid IPv4 address, return "IPv4".
```

**Example 2:**  

```
Input: "2001:0db8:85a3:0:0:8A2E:0370:7334"

Output: "IPv6"

Explanation: This is a valid IPv6 address, return "IPv6".
```

**Example 3:**  

```
Input: "256.256.256.256"

Output: "Neither"

Explanation: This is neither a IPv4 address nor a IPv6 address.
```


#### Solution

Language: **Python3**

```python3
class Solution:
    def validIPAddress(self, IP: str) -> str:
        if '.' in IP:
            return self.validIP4Address(IP)
        if ':' in IP:
            return self.validIP6Address(IP)
        return "Neither"

    def validIP4Address(self,IP):
        IP=IP.split('.')
        if len(IP)!=4:
            return "Neither"
        for ip in IP:
            if len(ip)>3:
                return "Neither"
            for num in ip:
                if num not in '1234567890':
                    return "Neither"
            if not ip:
                return "Neither"
            if ip[0]=='0' and len(ip)>1:
                return "Neither"
            if int(ip)>255:
                return "Neither"
        return "IPv4"
    
    def validIP6Address(self,IP):
        IP=IP.lower()
        IP=IP.split(':')
        if len(IP)!=8:
            return "Neither"
        for ip in IP:
            if len(ip)>4:
                return "Neither"
            for num in ip:
                if num not in '1234567890abcdef':
                    return "Neither"
            if not ip:
                return "Neither"
        return "IPv6"
```

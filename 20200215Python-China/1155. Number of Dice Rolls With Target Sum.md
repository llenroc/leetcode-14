### [1155\. Number of Dice Rolls With Target Sum](https://leetcode-cn.com/problems/number-of-dice-rolls-with-target-sum/)

Difficulty: **中等**


You have `d` dice, and each die has `f` faces numbered `1, 2, ..., f`.

Return the number of possible ways (out of `f<sup>d</sup>` total ways) **modulo `10^9 + 7`** to roll the dice so the sum of the face up numbers equals `target`.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: d = 1, f = 6, target = 3
Output: 1
Explanation: 
You throw one die with 6 faces.  There is only one way to get a sum of 3.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: d = 2, f = 6, target = 7
Output: 6
Explanation: 
You throw two dice, each with 6 faces.  There are 6 ways to get a sum of 7:
1+6, 2+5, 3+4, 4+3, 5+2, 6+1.
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: d = 2, f = 5, target = 10
Output: 1
Explanation: 
You throw two dice, each with 5 faces.  There is only one way to get a sum of 10: 5+5.
```

**Example 4:**

```
Input: d = 1, f = 2, target = 3
Output: 0
Explanation: 
You throw one die with 2 faces.  There is no way to get a sum of 3.
```

**Example 5:**

```
Input: d = 30, f = 30, target = 500
Output: 222616187
Explanation: 
The answer must be returned modulo 10^9 + 7.
```

**Constraints:**

*   `1 <= d, f <= 30`
*   `1 <= target <= 1000`


#### Solution

Language: **Python3**

```python3
class Solution:
    def numRollsToTarget(self, d: int, f: int, target: int) -> int:
        dict_sum={}
        for _ in range(d):
            tmp={}
            if not dict_sum:
                for num in range(1,f+1):
                    tmp[num]=1
            else:
                for num in range(1,f+1):
                    for k in dict_sum:
                        if num+k not in tmp:
                            tmp[num+k]=dict_sum[k]
                        else:
                            tmp[num+k]+=dict_sum[k]
            dict_sum=tmp
        if target in dict_sum:
            return dict_sum[target]%(10**9+7)
        else:
            return 0
```

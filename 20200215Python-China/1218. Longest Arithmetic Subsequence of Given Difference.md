### [1218\. Longest Arithmetic Subsequence of Given Difference](https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-arithmetic-subsequence-of-given-difference/)

Difficulty: **Medium**


Given an integer array `arr` and an integer `<font face="monospace" style="display: inline;">difference</font>`, return the length of the longest subsequence in <font face="monospace" style="display: inline;">`arr` </font>which is an arithmetic sequence such that the difference between adjacent elements in the subsequence equals `difference`.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: arr = [1,2,3,4], difference = 1
Output: 4
Explanation: The longest arithmetic subsequence is [1,2,3,4].
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: arr = [1,3,5,7], difference = 1
Output: 1
Explanation: The longest arithmetic subsequence is any single element.
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: arr = [1,5,7,8,5,3,4,2,1], difference = -2
Output: 4
Explanation: The longest arithmetic subsequence is [7,5,3,1].
```

**Constraints:**

*   `1 <= arr.length <= 10^5`
*   `-10^4 <= arr[i], difference <= 10^4`


#### Solution

Language: **Python3**

```python3
class Solution:
    def longestSubsequence(self, arr: List[int], difference: int) -> int:
        dict_arr={}
        rep=0
        for num in arr:
            if num-difference not in dict_arr:
                dict_arr[num]=1
            else:
                dict_arr[num]=1+dict_arr[num-difference]
            rep=max(rep,dict_arr[num])
        return rep
```

### [539\. Minimum Time Difference](https://leetcode-cn.com/problems/minimum-time-difference/)

Difficulty: **中等**

Given a list of 24-hour clock time points in "Hour:Minutes" format, find the minimum **minutes** difference between any two time points in the list.

**Example 1:**  

```
Input: ["23:59","00:00"]
Output: 1
```

**Note:**  

1.  The number of time points in the given list is at least 2 and won't exceed 20000.
2.  The input time is legal and ranges from 00:00 to 23:59.


#### Solution

Language: **Python3**

```python3
class Solution:
    def findMinDifference(self, timePoints: List[str]) -> int:
        timePoints.sort(key=lambda x: int(x[3:5]))
        timePoints.sort(key=lambda x: int(x[:2]))
        rep=24*60-int(timePoints[-1][3:5])-int(timePoints[-1][:2])*60+int(timePoints[0][3:5])+int(timePoints[0][:2])*60
        for k in range(1,len(timePoints)):
            cur=int(timePoints[k][3:5])+int(timePoints[k][:2])*60
            cur+=-int(timePoints[k-1][3:5])-int(timePoints[k-1][:2])*60
            rep=min(rep,cur)
        return rep
```

### [151\. Reverse Words in a String](https://leetcode-cn.com/problems/reverse-words-in-a-string/)

Difficulty: **中等**


Given an input string, reverse the string word by word.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: "the sky is blue"
Output: "blue is sky the"
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: "  hello world!  "
Output: "world! hello"
Explanation: Your reversed string should not contain leading or trailing spaces.
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: "a good   example"
Output: "example good a"
Explanation: You need to reduce multiple spaces between two words to a single space in the reversed string.
```

**Note:**

*   A word is defined as a sequence of non-space characters.
*   Input string may contain leading or trailing spaces. However, your reversed string should not contain leading or trailing spaces.
*   You need to reduce multiple spaces between two words to a single space in the reversed string.

For C programmers, try to solve it _in-place_ in _O_(1) extra space.


#### Solution

Language: **Python3**

```python3
class Solution:
    def reverseWords(self, s: str) -> str:
        s=s.strip()

        if not s:
            return ""

        r=len(s)-1
        while r>=0 and s[r]!=' ':
            r-=1
        if r==-1:
            return s

        r+=1
        return s[r:]+' '+self.reverseWords(s[:r])
```
